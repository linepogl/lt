            Installation by Efi Fouriki
            Original music by Lambros Taklis

            Video projection on a reflective surface

            The work started from a super-8 film showing the pupils of a primary school. This material was transferred on video, invested with a musical theme composed specifically for the work by Lambros Taklis and projected on the reflective surface of a special screen. Viewers watch on the screen the faces of the children, which the specific material transforms into light that spreads all over the site of the installation.
